# todo_react_native
Simple ToDo application in react native using typescript.

Made this application to try my hands out on typescript with react-native. You can add a task and mark it complete/in-complete.

Future scope: 
1) Removing the task.
2) Writing test cases using react-native-testing-library.
3) Setting up reminder.
